# MyGreenBank, UQ Design Studio 2017

An Android app for Laotian farmers made for the Laos-Australia Teak Agroforestry Research Project

MyGreenBank is an Android application that will allow users to consistently estimate the market value of teak trees as well as provide tools for tracking and managing teak plantations. With a few basic measurements of the tree in question, a user can receive a consistent estimate for how much of the tree is of merchantable quality and the value of said timber. This gives each farmer a much more educated position while negotiating timber sales, allowing them to maximise their investment.

The application also allows users to save this data about their trees for later use, as well as group trees by plantation (or ‘plot’). In the case where a user has so many trees that measuring each one becomes unrealistic, they can also use these groupings to give an aggregated total for all trees in a plot. MyGreenBank allows users to save location data (including a Google Maps geotag) of their tree plots. This information can carry much greater value amongst certain timber markets where end purchasers may value the knowledge and proof of their timber source.
